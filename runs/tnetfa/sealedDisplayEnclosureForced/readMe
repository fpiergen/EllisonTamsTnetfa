This model does not take into account the LCD in the enclosure. Trying to get an idea of the temperature inside the enclosure with predicted 
power input. Using various elements for forced convection. Turbulent, Laminar etc... to get an idea of a range. I am getting a range of about 8 to 16 degree C rise for a 150W intput. Look into estimating the air flow in the channels.
