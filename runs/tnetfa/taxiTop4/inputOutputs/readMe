-1 Natural Convection with two air gaps light power into LCD
-2 Natural Convection with two air gaps light power into air space 
-3 Natural Convection with two air gaps light power 40W into air space 20W into LCD
-4 Forced Convection outside fin side with two air gaps light power 40W into air space 20W into LCD.
-5 Forced Convection outside fin side with two air gaps light power 40W into air space 20W into LCD.
   try to use forced convection elements for inside faces, temps are high compared to test for 4
-6 Forced Convection outside fin side with two air gaps light power 40W into air space 20W into LCD Forced conv inside with bigger fans.
   predict temps for Tuesday's test
WIP  working on model of last test with internal fans. Need to find what volumetric flow is.
